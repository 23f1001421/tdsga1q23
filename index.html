4. Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"** (this saves the file)

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

Now you tell GitHub to turn your repo into a live website.

1. Go to your repo's main page
2. Click the **"Settings"** tab (near the top, with a gear icon)
3. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click **"Pages"**
4. Under **"Branch"**, select `main` from the dropdown, leave the folder as `/ (root)`, and click **Save**

GitHub will show a message like: *"Your site is ready to be published at `https://yourusername.github.io/portfolio/`"*

### Step 5: Wait a Minute, Then Visit Your URL

GitHub takes 1–3 minutes to build your site. Then go to:
```
https://[your-github-username].github.io/[your-repo-name]/
```

For example, if your username is `johndoe` and your repo is `portfolio`, the URL is:
```
https://johndoe.github.io/portfolio/
```

You should see your HTML page live on the internet!

### Step 6: If You Don't See Your Latest Changes

GitHub Pages is sometimes cached (it shows an old version). If that happens, add `?v=1` to the end of your URL:
```
https://johndoe.github.io/portfolio/?v=1
```

---

### Step 7: Submit Your URL

Copy your GitHub Pages URL and submit it as your answer. It should look like:
```
https://[USER].github.io/[REPO]/
